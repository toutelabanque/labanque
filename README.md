La Banque is a mock bank website and backend. It supports checking accounts, savings accounts, Certificates of Deposit, loans, direct money transfers, taxes, debit cards, and more*. This is dealing with play money, so the security is simple.
This is a simple full stack web app. It has a frontend with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, Python with Flask in the backend, and a simple SQLite3 database.

###### *Much of this is unimplemented on the frontend as of yet.
