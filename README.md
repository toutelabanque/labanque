# labanque
La Banque is a mock bank website and backend. It supports checking accounts, savings accounts, Certificates of Deposit, loans, direct money transfers, taxes, credit/debit cards, and more*. This is dealing with play money, so the security is basic.  
This is a simple full stack web app. It has a frontend with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, Python with Flask in the backend, and a simple SQLite3 database.

- Run `run.bat` to run the website on localhost with debug mode on.
- Run `python app.py` to run it on all hosts (0.0.0.0), meaning localhost and your LAN. Debug mode is off in this case (security).

###### \*Some of this is unimplemented on the frontend as of yet.
